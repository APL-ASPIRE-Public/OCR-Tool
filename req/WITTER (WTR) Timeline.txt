WITTER (WTR) Timeline Rough Draft
(given everything goes accordingly)


Week of 2/1/2021
* Review Requirements to make sure they are accurate to what we want to make
* Begin the process of figuring out how we want to have our app built
* Consider GUI design, Architecture of the NN, what platforms we will use (and how), resources we will use and how often we will communicate.
* Reconvene with Matt to check on how we are doing


Week of 2/8/2021
* Begin the set up for the NN, Model, and Travis CI
* Create the basic NN and create a cell divided version on Co-Lab for testing.
* Begin figuring out GUI designing and how to use it in our project
* Small testing to determine what kind of Regularization and Activation will be best.
* Reconvene


Week of 2/15/2021
* Test and experiment with the NN in branches of Co-lab to maximize accuracy (>99%)
* Check if debugging is needed
* Continue to make a GUI that would work efficiently while being simple enough that (almost) anyone could use it.
* Possible testing on live data
* Reconvene
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week of 2/22/2021
* Continue testing in Co-lab and find the best NN.
* Check for debugging needs
* Finish the GUI in order to make it so you can select an image file to identify (made for whole pages, 0-9, A-Z possibility)
* Reconvene


Week of 3/1/2021
* Finalize the ML Model and connect it to a function in the GUI to read the selected file
* Test on live data/experiment with the program as a whole
* Make sure there aren't glitches or bugs, if so, fix and debug
* Reconvene


Week of 3/8/2021
* Debug
* Fix glitches
* Fine-tune everything
* Make a “well-oiled machine”


Week of 3/15/2021
